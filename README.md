In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. 
Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body.
In natural language processing, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model 
that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar
